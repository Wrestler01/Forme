                In 2016, I started to continue my studies in academic lyceum. I have achieved a lot in 3 years. For example, I have returned to the world of sports and am working in a different direction. I chose the Arm Wrestling sport on the recommendation of my high school coach and got the results I deserved. I intend to further increase the number of my achievements in the future. In those years, I was fortunate enough to enter a university in exchange for a lot of preparation. This was caused by my teachers and I thank them. I also received an IELTS certificate during those years.
