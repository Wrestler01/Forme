                In 2007 I saw school life in first time and feld very surprised. Because it was very different from my home life. There were more people. I found my first friend from there.  At the begenning of school life I learned new things, subject, communication with people. After few years I became elder and I started to develop my education skills to apply for academic lyceum. In that way I had more difficulties, problems but I didn't stop. As my school was located near to my home, I went to there on foot with my friends. During my school years, I participated in various clubs and sports. For example, wrestling, English, math, etc. But for some reason in my health I had to leave the world of sports for a few years. In 2016, I entered the Academic Lyceum of Finance under the Tashkent Financial Institute.
